Transform your Enterprise Team into AI-Native Engineers in 3 Days

---

## **BLOCK 2: HERO SECTION - MAIN SUBTITLE**
**File**: `src/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx`

In this course, your team will stop programming the old way. No more hand-writing code, specs, or tests. Instead, every Scrum role‚Äîfrom developer to designer to product owner‚Äîwill work through intelligent agents like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek.

Using the open-source Cursor Memory Bank, your team collaborates with agents to plan, build, and reflect. Personal knowledge is captured, shared, and transformed into collective intelligence. The result? Software development that accelerates with every sprint‚Äîand a team that thinks, works, and learns in a fundamentally new way.

## **BLOCK 11: PROBLEM/SOLUTION SECTION - MAIN HEADING**
**File**: `src/components/sections/ProblemSolutionSection.tsx`

The Future of Software Development: Agents Write the Code‚ÄîYou Guide the Intelligence

---

## **BLOCK 12: PROBLEM/SOLUTION SECTION - SUBTITLE**
**File**: `src/components/sections/ProblemSolutionSection.tsx`

In this transformational course, your Scrum team will learn to build software in a completely new way:
Agents‚Äîlike ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and DeepSeek‚Äîwrite the code, generate requirements, create tests, design interfaces, and produce documentation. Humans no longer manually write these artifacts.

This is Agentic Programming: a paradigm where every role in your team collaborates with intelligent agents to plan, design, implement, and evolve software systems‚Äîfaster, more reflectively, and with growing organizational intelligence.

This isn't about building AI apps. It's about building everything else‚Äîwith AI.

## **BLOCK 13: PROBLEM/SOLUTION SECTION - PROBLEMS**
**File**: `src/components/sections/ProblemSolutionSection.tsx`

üß† The Paradigm Shift
- You don't write the code anymore. Agents do.
- Your job is to guide, review, and refine their work‚Äîlike a lead engineer, architect, or strategist working through intelligent collaborators.
- Every role in your Scrum team‚Äîdeveloper, tester, designer, architect, product owner‚Äîworks through agents to:
- Assess product goals, constraints, and technical approaches
- Plan sprints, epics, user stories, and architecture
- Design APIs, UIs, data models, and system interactions
- Implement production-ready code, tests, configs, docs
- Reflect through retrospectives and feed learning into memory

---

## **BLOCK 14: PROBLEM/SOLUTION SECTION - SOLUTIONS**
**File**: `src/components/sections/ProblemSolutionSection.tsx`

üîÅ Memory and Learning: From Personal to Organizational Intelligence
- Using Cursor Memory Bank, the system builds persistent knowledge‚Äînot just output. It enables:
- Personal Knowledge Loops: Each human‚Äìagent pairing creates a personal memory space‚Äîrecording context, rationale, preferences, and lessons learned.
- Team Knowledge Overlap: These memories connect via reflection and memory modes, forming overlapping Venn diagrams of shared understanding.
- A Living Project Knowledge Base: These intersections create a persistent team or organizational memory‚Äîa knowledge system that accelerates delivery by learning from every interaction.
- Rooted in Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) and Knowledge Management (KM) theory, this model:
- Captures both tacit and explicit knowledge
- Embeds learning directly into the development process
- Turns retrospectives into fuel for smarter agent behavior
- Makes every future sprint faster and more informed than the last
