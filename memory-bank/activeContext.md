## VAN Mode Analysis (2024-12-20)

### Project State Assessment
- **Health Check**: `npm install` and `npm run build` executed successfully.
- **Build Time**: 3.0s
- **Bundle Size**: 133kB First Load JS for the main page.
- **Status**: The project is in a healthy, deployable state. All previous tasks, including the Level 4 User Registration system, are complete and archived.

### Enhancement Opportunities
Based on a review of the project's state and the `progress.md` file, the following opportunities have been identified:

1.  **SEO Path Correction (Level 1):** The `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` files may not be correctly resolved in the static export for GitHub Pages. This is a small but important fix for search engine visibility.
2.  **Automated Testing Foundation (Level 2):** The project currently lacks an automated testing suite. Introducing Vitest and React Testing Library would significantly improve long-term stability and code quality.
3.  **Content Management System (Level 4):** Adding a blog or a dynamic content section would enhance SEO and provide a platform for audience engagement. This represents a significant new feature.
