# ACTIVE CONTEXT

## Current Status: VAN Mode Active - Ready for Task Vision

**VAN Mode Status**: ✅ ACTIVE  
**Project State**: All tasks completed and archived  
**Memory Bank**: Fully operational and ready  
**Focus**: Awaiting new task specification for vision analysis  

## Recently Completed Task: Hero Section Authority Points Update (Level 1)

**Completion Date**: June 2024  
**Archive Document**: [memory-bank/archive/archive-level1-hero-section-authority-points-update.md](archive/archive-level1-hero-section-authority-points-update.md)  
**Final Status**: COMPLETED with full design/content parity  

### Task Summary
Successfully updated the authority/feature indicators in the hero section to match the required four points, improved spacing and layout, and ensured visual and content parity with design requirements. All changes were implemented quickly and with no regressions.

### Key Achievements
- **Content Parity**: Authority/feature points now match the required content precisely
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Improved spacing and layout for clarity and balance
- **Rapid Implementation**: All changes implemented quickly and with no regressions

### Lessons Learned for Future Tasks
- Direct visual feedback (screenshots) is highly effective for rapid, precise UI iteration
- Using fixed width/height for cards is the most reliable way to guarantee alignment in a flex layout
- Consistent use of spacing tokens (mt, mb, my) in MUI ensures visual balance

## Current Focus: Available for New Task

**Memory Bank Readiness**:
- **tasks.md**: Cleared and ready for new task documentation
- **progress.md**: Updated with completed task archive reference
- **reflection.md**: Available for next task reflection process
- **All core files**: Operational and ready for new task workflow

**Recommended Initialization**: Use VAN Mode to assess new task requirements and determine appropriate complexity level and implementation approach.

## Next Task Readiness: ✅ READY
