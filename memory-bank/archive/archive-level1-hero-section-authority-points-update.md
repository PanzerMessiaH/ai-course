# Archive: Level 1 - Hero Section Authority Points Update

## Task Overview
- **Task**: Update the authority/feature indicators in the hero section to the new four points
- **Type**: Level 1 - Quick Bug Fix
- **Component**: HeroSection authority indicators
- **Status**: Completed
- **Completion Date**: June 2024

## Problem Identified
- Previous points: Led by industry professionals, Hands-on learning, Proven methodologies
- Required points:
  1. Agents Write the Code. You Guide the Intelligence.
  2. Team Knowledge Compounds via Shared Memory
  3. Full-Role Transformation Across the Scrum Team
  4. Backed by PKM & KM Theory for Organizational Learning
- Content mismatch between implementation and new requirements

## Solution & Implementation
1. Located the AuthorityIndicator components in HeroSection
2. Updated the content to the four new points
3. Verified visual layout and spacing for clarity and balance
4. Improved spacing above and below the authority points and CTA button for visual balance

## Successes
- Authority/feature points now match the required content precisely
- Visual hierarchy and spacing improved for clarity and balance
- All changes were implemented quickly and with no regressions

## Challenges
- Minor linter issues with quote formatting (resolved with HTML entities)
- Ensuring pixel-perfect alignment and spacing required careful adjustment of MUI sx props

## Lessons Learned
- Direct visual feedback (screenshots) is highly effective for rapid, precise UI iteration
- Using fixed width/height for cards is the most reliable way to guarantee alignment in a flex layout
- Consistent use of spacing tokens (mt, mb, my) in MUI ensures visual balance

## Process/Technical Improvements
- Consider extracting common spacing values into a theme or constants for easier future adjustments
- Continue using semantic HTML and accessible ARIA labels for all interactive and informational elements
