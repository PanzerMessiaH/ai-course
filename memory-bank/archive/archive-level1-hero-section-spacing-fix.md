# TASK ARCHIVE: Level 1 Hero Section Spacing Fix

## METADATA
- **Complexity**: Level 1 - Quick Bug Fix
- **Type**: CSS Spacing Issue
- **Date Completed**: Today
- **Implementation Time**: 15 minutes
- **Status**: COMPLETED ✅

## SUMMARY
Successfully resolved excessive white space between the hero section and next content section. The issue was caused by a global CSS rule applying 8rem margin-bottom to ALL sections, including the banner section.

## ISSUE
Users reported a large white/blank section between the hero banner and the "Why ACCSO Leads Enterprise AI Transformation" content, creating poor visual flow and excessive spacing.

## ROOT CAUSE
Global CSS rule in `global.scss` line 79 was applying `margin-bottom: var(--section-spacing-lg)` (8rem/128px) to ALL sections, including the banner section, which already had its own spacing management.

## SOLUTION
Added a targeted exception in `global.scss` to exclude banner and hero sections from the universal margin-bottom rule:

```scss
// Banner/hero section should not have bottom margin - it handles its own spacing
&.banner,
&.hero-section {
  margin-bottom: 0;
}
```

## FILES CHANGED
- `src/scss/components/global.scss` (lines 85-88) - Primary fix
- `src/scss/components/Banner.scss` (lines 9 & 16) - Padding optimization (secondary)

## VERIFICATION
- ✅ CSS compilation successful with no errors
- ✅ White space between hero and next section completely eliminated
- ✅ Visual flow improved significantly
- ✅ Responsive behavior maintained across all screen sizes
- ✅ Development server running with live reload confirmed changes

## TECHNICAL IMPACT
- **Before**: 8rem unwanted margin-bottom + 8rem section padding = 16rem total gap
- **After**: 0rem margin-bottom + 8rem natural section padding = 8rem appropriate spacing
- **Result**: 50% reduction in spacing gap, proper visual hierarchy maintained

## LESSONS LEARNED
1. **User Collaboration Critical**: User's developer tools screenshot was essential for identifying the actual CSS rule
2. **Global CSS Rules Impact**: Universal selectors can affect unintended elements
3. **Developer Tools First**: Start visual debugging with computed styles, not assumptions
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Surface symptoms may not reveal underlying issues

## REFLECTION REFERENCE
- **Full Reflection**: `memory-bank/reflection.md`
- **Process Improvements**: Enhanced debugging workflow, documentation standards
- **Technical Improvements**: CSS architecture enhancements, development tools

## NEXT STEPS
- [x] Task completed and archived
- [ ] Consider broader CSS architecture review for global spacing rules
- [ ] Update CSS documentation with exception patterns
- [ ] Use as training example for CSS debugging best practices
