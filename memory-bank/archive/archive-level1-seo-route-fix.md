# Bug Fix Archive: SEO Route Fix (Level 1)

## Date
2024-09-06

## Summary
This task fixed an issue where `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` were generated with a hardcoded base URL for a Vercel deployment, causing them to be incorrect for the GitHub Pages environment. The fix involved using an environment variable (`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`) to dynamically generate the correct base URL.

## Implementation
- Replaced the hardcoded `baseUrl` string in `src/app/robots.ts` and `src/app/sitemap.ts` with `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.
- Added a fallback to `http://localhost:3000` for local development.
- Corrected outdated paths in the `sitemap.ts` file.

## Files Changed
- `src/app/robots.ts`
- `src/app/sitemap.ts`

## Lessons Learned
- Using environment variables for environment-specific values is a critical best practice.
- It's important to verify changes against the latest build artifacts to avoid confusion from caching.
