## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Content Text Updates (30 minutes)
**HeroSection.tsx Changes:**
- Hero subtitle reordered for better flow and impact
- Course description enhanced with more compelling action language
- Memory Bank and PRP methodologies highlighted with co-planning terminology
- Authority indicator updated for stronger foundational positioning

**AuthoritySection.tsx Changes:**
- Company description modernized with transformation and competitiveness focus
- Updated from "leading technology partner" to "delivers transformation at scale"
- Enhanced global presence messaging (350+ specialists, 5 global hubs)

**BenefitsSection.tsx Changes:**
- Benefits section title changed to create urgency ("In 3 Days, your Team will:")
- Call-to-action updated to "Ready to Claim your Seat?" for stronger engagement
- Removed duplicated company information section as requested
- Enhanced waitlist messaging with "careerâ€‘defining leap" language

### Phase 2: Footer Visual Enhancement (15 minutes)
**Visual Elements Added:**
- Gradient background: `linear-gradient(135deg, var(--dark-green) 0%, #1a4d3a 50%, var(--dark-green) 100%)`
- Subtle radial gradient overlays for visual depth
- Enhanced course information section with:
  - Rounded border design (`borderRadius: '0 20px 0 20px'`)
  - Subtle background highlighting (`rgba(105, 255, 148, 0.08)`)
  - Neon green border accent (`rgba(105, 255, 148, 0.2)`)
  - Rocket emoji (ðŸš€) for visual excitement and engagement
- Improved visual hierarchy with proper z-index layering

### Phase 3: QA Completion Round (15 minutes)
When user indicated missing updates, conducted systematic component-by-component verification:
- Identified and completed remaining AuthoritySection company description update
- Verified BenefitsSection duplicated content removal
- Confirmed all text changes matched user specifications exactly
- Validated build integrity and performance preservation

## Testing Performed

- **Build Validation**: `npm run build` completed successfully with all 15 static pages generated
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Zero compilation errors throughout implementation
- **Linting Verification**: All ESLint checks passed without warnings
- **Performance Testing**: Main page size maintained at 2.55kB (no performance degradation)
- **Responsive Design**: All text changes fit existing layouts perfectly across viewport sizes
- **Content Verification**: Each component manually verified for exact text matching user specifications
- **Visual Enhancement Testing**: Footer gradient and styling elements working properly with existing design system

## Lessons Learned

### Process Improvements
- **Systematic Verification Required**: Multi-component content updates need explicit checklist-based tracking to ensure complete coverage and prevent missed requirements
- **Component-by-Component QA**: Verification should examine each affected component individually rather than relying on general build success as validation
- **User Specifications as Exact Requirements**: When users provide specific wording suggestions, treat them as exact requirements rather than general guidance

### Technical Insights
- **Content Updates Are Low-Risk High-Value**: Text content changes in React components have minimal technical risk but high user experience impact
- **Material UI Typography Flexibility**: Existing Typography components handled all content length changes gracefully without layout issues
- **Static Build Compatibility**: All content changes remained compatible with Next.js static site generation with zero performance impact

### Implementation Strategy
- **Before/After Documentation**: Document specific before and after text for each change to ensure accuracy and provide clear audit trail
- **Multi-Pass Verification Protocol**: Implement verification approach with initial implementation â†’ self-QA â†’ build validation â†’ user confirmation
- **Content Change Checklist System**: Create explicit checklist template with component locations and line references for systematic verification
