## ORIGINAL PROBLEM STATEMENT

### User Feedback
"Website feels like a wall of text. We want professional cleanup inspired by SectionAI website (https://www.sectionai.com/mini-mba/ai-for-programmers-mini-mba), needs to 'sound like we are THE experts in this field'"

### Identified Issues
1. **Dense Content Blocks**: WhyAccso section had long, unstructured bullet points
2. **Weak Authority Language**: Generic descriptions instead of expert positioning
3. **Poor Visual Breaks**: Sections ran together without clear separation
4. **Inconsistent Messaging**: Some sections more professional than others
5. **Missing Expert Credibility**: Didn't establish domain authority

### Constraints
- Cannot add detailed syllabus (not yet developed)
- Must work within existing component structure
- Need to maintain responsive design
- Enterprise-appropriate tone required
