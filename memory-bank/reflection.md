# Reflection: Hero Section Authority Points Update (Level 1)

## Task Overview
- **Task**: Update the authority/feature indicators in the hero section to the new four points
- **Type**: Level 1 - Quick Bug Fix
- **Component**: HeroSection authority indicators
- **Status**: Completed

## Review & Comparison to Plan
- All requested content and layout changes were implemented exactly as specified.
- Visual and content parity with user screenshots and requirements was achieved.
- Spacing, alignment, and responsive design were improved for a more professional look.

## Successes
- Authority/feature points now match the required content precisely.
- Visual hierarchy and spacing improved for clarity and balance.
- All changes were implemented quickly and with no regressions.

## Challenges
- Minor linter issues with quote formatting (resolved with HTML entities).
- Ensuring pixel-perfect alignment and spacing required careful adjustment of MUI sx props.

## Lessons Learned
- Direct visual feedback (screenshots) is highly effective for rapid, precise UI iteration.
- Using fixed width/height for cards is the most reliable way to guarantee alignment in a flex layout.
- Consistent use of spacing tokens (mt, mb, my) in MUI ensures visual balance.

## Process/Technical Improvements
- Consider extracting common spacing values into a theme or constants for easier future adjustments.
- Continue using semantic HTML and accessible ARIA labels for all interactive and informational elements.
