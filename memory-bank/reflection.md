# REFLECTION WORKSPACE

This file is available for the next task reflection. Individual reflections are stored in the `reflection/` directory with specific naming conventions.

## Recent Reflection
- **Latest**: [Landing Page Visual Improvements (Level 2)](reflection/reflection-level2-landing-page-visual-improvements.md)

## Reflection Directory Structure
Individual reflection documents follow the naming pattern:
- `reflection-level[X]-[task-name].md` for completed tasks
- Organized chronologically for easy reference

## Usage
This workspace file gets updated with each new reflection process, while the completed reflections are preserved in the reflection directory for future reference and learning.
