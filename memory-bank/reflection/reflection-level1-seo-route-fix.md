# Reflection: SEO Route Fix (Level 1)

## 1. Review of Implementation and Comparison to Plan
The plan was to analyze, identify, implement, and verify a fix for SEO files (`robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`) that were not working correctly on the GitHub Pages deployment. The implementation followed the plan perfectly.

## 2. Successes
- **Dynamic Base URL:** The root cause, a hardcoded `baseUrl` for a Vercel deployment, was identified and replaced with `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`. This is a significant improvement that allows the application to generate correct SEO files for any deployment environment without code changes.
- **Sitemap Correction:** Outdated paths in `sitemap.ts` were removed, ensuring the generated `sitemap.xml` is accurate.
- **Successful Verification:** The fix was successfully verified by running a production build and inspecting the generated `out/` directory, confirming the environment variable was correctly applied.

## 3. Challenges
- There were no significant technical challenges during this task. A moment of confusion occurred when an older build artifact was inspected, but this was not a flaw in the implementation itself.

## 4. Lessons Learned
- **Environment Variables are Key:** This task reinforces the importance of using environment variables for all environment-specific configurations.
- **Verify Against Source:** When build artifacts appear incorrect, the first step should be to double-check the source code to confirm the changes were applied correctly before assuming a more complex problem.
