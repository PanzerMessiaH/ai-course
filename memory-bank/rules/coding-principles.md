# Coding Principles (CV Series)

## CV-01 Series - Simplicity & Clarity
- CV-01.1: Solutions MUST prioritize simplicity over complexity.
- CV-01.2: Every component MUST have a single, clear responsibility.
- CV-01.3: Implementations MUST favor readability over cleverness.
- CV-01.4: Documentation MUST be clear, concise, and current.

## CV-02 Series - Automation & Workflows
- CV-02.1: Workflows MUST be fully automated where possible.
- CV-02.2: Manual processes MUST be minimized to approval steps only.
- CV-02.3: All system state MUST be digitally tracked and visible.
- CV-02.4: Interfaces between systems MUST be well-defined with clear contracts.

## CV-03 Series - Architecture & Adaptability
- CV-03.1: Architecture MUST support incremental development.
- CV-03.2: Components MUST be designed for easy replacement or upgrade.
- CV-03.3: System MUST support rapid deployment of changes.
- CV-03.4: Feedback loops MUST be integrated at every stage.

## Application Guidelines
- Prioritize single responsibility and clear interfaces
- Automate everything except human decision points
- Design for change and rapid iteration
- Maintain comprehensive feedback mechanisms
