# Core Rules

## CR Series - Core Rules
- CR-01: Prioritize user intent and project goals in responses.
- CR-02: Use hierarchical rule loading: Core first, then principles/optimizations.
- CR-03: Token efficiency: Lazy-load detailed rules; summarize where possible.
- CR-04: Adapt responses to task complexity levels 1-4 from @memory-bank/tasks.md.
- CR-05: Ensure all outputs are traceable to rules or context files.

## Rule Application
- Load hierarchically: Core rules first, then specifics as needed
- All responses must align with user intent and project goals
- Complexity levels determine detail depth and resource allocation
- Maintain traceability from output back to governing rules
